Details about the project are available in DataPreparation.ipynb

## Usage of QuAM.py

- Run the file using 'python3 QuAM.py'
- Write the name of the file corresponding to the dataset (link is above).
- Write 'y' if you want to classify the whole dataset, 'n' otherwise.
- If you wrote 'y', the program will output a file 'result.txt' with all the classifications.
- If you wrote 'n', write the row number of the DNA sequence you want to classify. It will then print out the result.
